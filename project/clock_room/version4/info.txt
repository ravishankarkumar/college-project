Version Info:

     there was a bug in the previous systems.
     we were innocently releasing a lock if
     user was entring a PNR equivalent to lock-id
     generated by the system during the system initialization.
     i.e. we were over writing the status.
     so to overcome this bug a new version is released
     with a new error -5.
